# Converting LED Icons to PNG Format

You now have LED-style SVG icons created, but they need to be converted to PNG format for best compatibility with the tray system.

## Quick Conversion Methods:

### Method 1: Using the HTML Generator (Recommended)
1. The file `create-led-icons.html` should have opened in your browser
2. You'll see three LED icon previews (16x16, 32x32, 64x64)
3. Click the "Download PNG" buttons to save the icons
4. Rename the downloaded files:
   - Rename `tray-icon-16x16.png` to `tray-icon.png`
   - Rename `tray-icon-32x32.png` to `icon.png`
5. Place these files in your project root directory
6. Restart the application

### Method 2: Online SVG to PNG Converter
1. Go to an online converter like:
   - convertio.co
   - cloudconvert.com
   - svgtopng.com
2. Upload `tray-icon.svg` and convert to PNG
3. Save as `tray-icon.png` in your project directory
4. Upload `icon.svg` and convert to PNG  
5. Save as `icon.png` in your project directory
6. Restart the application

### Method 3: Using Image Editor
1. Open `tray-icon.svg` in GIMP, Paint.NET, or Photoshop
2. Export/Save as PNG with filename `tray-icon.png`
3. Open `icon.svg` in your image editor
4. Export/Save as PNG with filename `icon.png`
5. Restart the application

## Current Files Created:
- âœ… `tray-icon.svg` - 16x16 LED pattern (needs conversion to PNG)
- âœ… `icon.svg` - 32x32 LED pattern (needs conversion to PNG)
- âœ… `create-led-icons.html` - Interactive icon generator (should be open in browser)

## Target Files Needed:
- ðŸŽ¯ `tray-icon.png` - 16x16 PNG version for tray
- ðŸŽ¯ `icon.png` - 32x32 PNG version for fallback

## LED Icon Design:
The icons feature:
- Black background (like an LED display when off)
- Bright orange/red LED dots in a pattern
- Dim background LEDs for authentic LED matrix look
- Border pattern with center elements
- Glow effects on bright LEDs

Once you have the PNG files, restart the application and you should see:
```
Tray icon loaded from: C:\...\tray-icon.png
```

Instead of:
```
No custom tray icon found, using system default.
